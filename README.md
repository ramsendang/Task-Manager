# Task-Manager
This is a assignment for software development in python (Msc. Computer Science) where I built a Task Manager Console application using python.

Abstract:
The Command-Line Task Manager is a Python-based application designed to provide a
streamlined and efficient solution for task management in a command-line interface. The
primary objective is to offer users a straightforward yet powerful tool to organize and prioritize
their tasks seamlessly.
Purpose:
In a fast-paced digital landscape, effective task management is crucial for productivity. The
Command-Line Task Manager addresses this need by offering a command-line interface that
eliminates the clutter of graphical interfaces, providing a focused and distraction-free
environment for users to manage their tasks.
Key Features:
1. Task Creation:
- Users can effortlessly add tasks to the system through a simple command, specifying task
details such as title, description, and due date.
2. Task Deletion:
- The application allows users to remove tasks they've completed or no longer need, ensuring
an organized task list.
3. Task Listing:
- A comprehensive task listing feature enables users to view all tasks at a glance. Tasks are
displayed with relevant details, facilitating quick assessment.
4. Status Updates:
- Users can update the status of tasks, indicating whether a task is pending, in progress, or
completed. This feature enhances visibility into task progress.
5. Interactive Interface:
- The application offers an interactive and user-friendly interface, guiding users through
various functionalities with clear prompts and instructions.
6. Data Persistence:
- Task data is persistently stored, ensuring that users can close and reopen the application
without losing their task information.
7. Customization Options: (Not made yet)
- The application allows users to customize their experience by adjusting settings, such as
default views or sorting preferences.
8. Due Date Tracking:
- The application includes due date functionality, helping users stay on top of deadlines and
manage their time effectively.
9. User-Friendly Commands:
- Commands are designed to be intuitive and easy to remember, reducing the learning curve
for users new to command-line interfaces.
Benefits:
- Focus and Productivity:
The application's minimalist design fosters focus, allowing users to concentrate on task
management without unnecessary distractions.
- Educational Tool:
The Command-Line Task Manager serves as an educational tool for individuals looking to
enhance their Python programming skills. The codebase is accessible, encouraging exploration
and learning.
- Integration Possibilities:
Due to its command-line nature, the application can be easily integrated into scripts or
automation processes, extending its utility beyond standalone task management.
- Efficient Task Tracking:
The combination of priority management, due date tracking, and status updates provides users
with a comprehensive system for efficiently tracking and completing tasks.
In summary, the Command-Line Task Manager application provides a meaningful as well as
multi feature solution for users in search of an effective and focused method for managing tasks
in a command-line setting. Its design prioritizes user-friendliness, customization, and
educational benefits, making it suitable for both productivity enthusiasts and those aspiring to
improve their proficiency in Python programming.
